# Website Design System
## Challenge Project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The goal of this challenge project is to create a basic design system that can be used for future website designing projects. 

I chose to focus on 3 visual design categories:
 - Website colour schemes (5 designs with hexadecimal reference)
 - Common font combinations (10 examples with Google Font hyperlinks)
 - Button styles (8 designs with HTML and CSS code provided)

For each category, I chose multiple examples to display some of my favourite styles and designs that I have found online. This project is intended to be used as a reference for future projects, so I have made the designs easy to copy and implement.

This is the largest Codecademy project I have completed so far. It was a great lerning experience that vastly broadened by understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals.

Please note that there was no starter code for this project - everything is hand coded.

## What I Learned
HTML
  - Designing a webpage from scratch and structuring it correctly with HTML semantic elements, classes, and ids.
  - Adding many fonts from Google Fonts API, with hyperlinks to them provided.
  - Using character entity references to display code that can be copied and pasted into any code editor with correct indentation.

CSS
  - Creating custom RGBA and hexadecimal colours and shadows
  - Using differnt types of gradients for the header background and some button styles 
  - Using flex and inline-block displays 
  - Various CSS animations for buttons using transitions, transformations and keyframes
  - Implementing :hover and :active pseudo-classes
  - Using :before and :after pseudo-elements to further style buttons
